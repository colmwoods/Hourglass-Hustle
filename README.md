# Timer
    #### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sFDZZZb5mI
    #### Description:
    This project is a Python script that gets to know your name then implements a timer, this timer is very handy and has very quick acess as you can access through a click in the termainl of your code editor. It also has features such aswhen yo click enter on your keyboard it will do a lap and you can do this as many times as yu want.

    This Python script is a simple timer application that allows the user to set a timer for a specified number of minutes. Here's a description of each part of the code:

Imports: The script imports the sys and time modules. sys is used for handling standard input and output, and time is used for time-related functions.

user() Function: This function prompts the user to enter their name and returns the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.

input_time(name) Function: This function takes the user's name as input and prompts them to enter the duration of the timer in minutes. It validates the input to ensure it's a number between 1 and 60. If the input is invalid, it prompts the user again. Once valid input is received, it prints a message confirming the timer is set and returns the number of minutes.

Timer(minutes) Function: This function takes the number of minutes as input and starts a timer for that duration. It continuously calculates the remaining time and updates the console output accordingly, showing the time remaining in the format mm:ss. Once the timer finishes, it prints a message indicating the time is up.

main() Function: This function serves as the entry point of the script. It calls the user() function to get the user's name, then calls the input_time() function to get the duration of the timer, and finally calls the Timer() function to start the timer.

Script Execution: The script checks if it's being run as the main program using if __name__ == "__main__":. If it is, it calls the main() function to start the timer application.
